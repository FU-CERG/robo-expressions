# Robo Expressions

## About

This simple project is to allow kids to create their own little robot, where a smartphone is the face of the robot.
It is inspired by [PopBots](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/pop-kit/overview/), but aims at students aged 12 or older.

The project itself is based on a codepen from sebastien.
